# VRCMenacingRegisterBoard
 A register board for VRChat written in UdonSharp (Based on C#).
 
 What is it?
A UdonSharp script for registering board system that takes registered player and teleport player to play area when ready.

 How it works?
If player want to register to play later, player can hit register button and hit again to unregister. When player hit and stay registered, their name will be shown on board. Once all players are ready, they can hit the play button and then everyone get teleported to play area.
 
The following project is a work in progress and does not fully work yet. In theory at current state this should work locally. In the future, the code should work over VRChat network.
Inside folder includes a prefab used as example. The following is assigned:
Green button: Register button
Blue: Play button.
Requirements: >2 players, 2-4 players to play.

Fell free to report issues and contribute fixes.
